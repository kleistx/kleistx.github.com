Iâ€™m kleistx, a programming enthusiast, focus on python,ruby and c#, always wanted to build something interesting and useful.

In my free time I love swimming,playing guitar and harmonica,cooking and settling down with a good book, and I also enjoy travelling around the world whenever I get the chance.
